### Review checklist:

<!--
Submitter Instructions:

Any items in the checklist that do not apply to this PR should be struck
through (using surrounding tilde characters, ~like so~) and a note explaining
why added as a sub-point under that item.

If this PR affects multiple services, add a header with the service name
before the checklist and duplicate the checklist for each service.  For
example:

#### conrad-ingest-matcher

- [ ] :x: Check stuff


#### conrad-ingest-selector

- [ ] :x: Check stuff

If this PR also includes library update(s) or staging deployment(s), add a
header to this checklist for this service and copy the relevant checklists from
the template(s) in .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/ here as well.

To signal to the reviewer that you as the submitter have checked each item,
replace each ':x:' with ':heavy_check_mark:'; the reviewer will use the
rendered checkboxes in the web interface.

Vim command for check mark replacement:
%s/:x:/:heavy_check_mark:/gc
