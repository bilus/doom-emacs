### Review checklist:

<!--
Submitter Instructions:

Any items in the checklist that do not apply to this PR should be struck
through (using surrounding tilde characters, ~like so~) and a note explaining
why added as a sub-point under that item.

If this PR also includes library or service update(s), or staging
deployment(s), add a header to this checklist and copy the relevant checklists
from the template(s) in .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/ here as well.

To signal to the reviewer that you as the submitter have checked each item,
replace each ':x:' with ':heavy_check_mark:'; the reviewer will use the
rendered checkboxes in the web interface.

Vim command for check mark replacement:
%s/:x:/:heavy_check_mark:/gc
-->

- [ ] :heavy_check_mark: \`make new_{major,minor,patch}_version\`
  - [ ] :heavy_check_mark: Dependencies up to date
  - [ ] :heavy_check_mark: Version bumped
  - [ ] :heavy_check_mark: Changelog amended
- [ ] :heavy_check_mark: Sanity checks passed (\`make check\`)
